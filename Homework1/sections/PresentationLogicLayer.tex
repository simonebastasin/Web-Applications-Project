The homepage contains the main information regarding the various products available.
The products are divided into subsets according to their category.This subdivision will be done by means of a scrollable list. Moreover, the homepage contains a bar to search by name of the single elements.
Like most of the top pages, the homepage contains a status bar that allows the user to register, log in or log out once logged in.
Finally, this status bar allows customers to show the history of the products purchased.

\subsection{Product page}

The product page shows in detail the information regarding the individual product.
This page shows all the pictures available for a given product, the description and its price.
In addition, it also shows any discount applied to the product.
If the customer is logged in, it will be possible for him to purchase the product within the maximum quantity available. It is possible to enter these particular pages by clicking on the product on the homepage or by searching by product name.

The user edit page allows the customer type user to change their personal data.The page will consist of text boxes with default values corresponding to the values previously entered by the user. The page allows you to change data such as telephone number, name, surname but not unique / primary key data. This is because these particular data are used for login, and to avoid conflicts it was decided to do so.
Obviously this page will be available only after the user login.
    
\subsection{Admin: product management}

\\
The product management pages can be accessed only by employees (and thus by administrators as well). The product list page displays and allows to edit and delete every product (even the ones with quantity equals to zero). It also allows to add a new product, through the add product page. Since every product belongs to a specific category, it is also possible to add a new category when adding a new product.  


\subsection{Admin: user management}
