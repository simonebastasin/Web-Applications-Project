The database has been modified, compared to the one created by e-team, improving the management of images, transforming
it from hard-coded within the records of the product to separate with an association N:N, this has allowed to realize
a more efficient and better management on the web app side.

The ticket part has been modified to make it 1:N (from 1:1) so it can contain all the information of the ticket history.

For the discount visualization was proposed the implementation of a view, but this could have problems with the storage
of the list in cache and increase the slowness in the upload phase, so in the end we preferred a nested query.

For the management of orders, the management has remained 1:1 with modification of the previous state because it was
not considered useful to save all the history.

Finally, nullable values, defaults, and small writing errors discovered during the implementation of the application
were corrected.
