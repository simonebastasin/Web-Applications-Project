The database has been modified, compared to the one created by the e-team, improving the management of images, transforming
it from hard-coded within the records of the product, to separated with an N:N association, this allowed to realize
a more efficient and better management on the web app side.

The ticket part has been modified to make it 1:N (from 1:1) so it can contain all the information about the ticket history.

For the discount visualization, we thought about implementing a view, but this could have caused problems with the storage
of the list in cache and it could have slowed down the uploading phase, so in the end we preferred a nested query.

For the management of orders, the relation has become 1:1 (from 1:N), because it was
not considered useful to save all the history.

Finally, nullable values, defaults, and small writing errors discovered during the implementation of the application
were corrected.
