\section{Group Members Contribution}

% For each group member, describe in detail the contribution to the project.
First, we discussed together the major functionalities of the web application we wanted to implement and scheduled how to carry on the project.
Then we split into three groups of three person each in order to develop the web application.


\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{Group 1}: Composed by Giole Ceccon, Alessandra Pastore and Matteo Pozzer was in charge of developing the homepage, the management of the orders, the management of the purchase of a product, the management of customers and employees accounts and the filter.
	\item \textbf{Group 2}: Composed by Simone Bortolin, Gil Czaczkes and Gianpietro Nicoletti was in charge to develop the ticket part, the login management, the management of the invoices and the upload of the pictures;
	\item \textbf{Group 3}: Composed by Simone Bastasin, Davide Colussi and Matteo Lando was in charge of developing the management of products, discounts, order status, employees and customers.

For each part, every group created the corresponding DAOs, resources (POJO), servlets and JSP pages.
The division is not to be considered strict, since people from different groups collaborated together with the objective of maintaining a general idea of the whole project.
