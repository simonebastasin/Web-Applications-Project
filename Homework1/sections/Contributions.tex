\section{Group Members Contribution}

% For each group member, describe in detail the contribution to the project.
At first, we discussed together the major functionalities of the web application we wanted to implement and scheduled how to carry on with the project.
To do so, we split into three major groups composed of three people each, in order to develop the web application more efficiently.


\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{Group 1}: Composed by Giole Ceccon, Alessandra Pastore and Matteo Pozzer was in charge of developing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the homepage
		\item the management of the orders
		\item the management of the purchases of a product by a customer
		\item the possible edit of customers and employees accounts
		\item the various filters to manage the session permits of each type of user
	\end{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{Group 2}: Composed by Simone Bortolin, Gil Czaczkes and Gianpietro Nicoletti was in charge of developing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the ticket part
		\item the login management
		\item the management of the invoices
		\item the upload and management of the media
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Group 3}: Composed by Simone Bastasin, Davide Colussi and Matteo Lando was in charge of the management side by employees and administrators, consisting of the following functions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item product management
		\item discount management
		\item order status management
		\item employee management
		\item customer management
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

For each task, each group coded all the corresponding DAOs, resources (POJO), servlets and JSP pages.
This division is not to be considered strict since everyone collaborated with each other in order to obtain a better final work 
and to allow everyone to know and learn all kind of possible tasks. 
In particular this approach was useful to maintain a general idea of the project allowing everyone to contribute to the final project as a whole.
